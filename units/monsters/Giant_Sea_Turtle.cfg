    description= _ "A legend states that once, in the old days of Wesnoth, an island appeared out of nowhere off the coast of a certain wealthy baron. Intrigued, the baron deployed a fleet to investigate the appearance. Three moons later, the humans realized that the island was getting no closer. When the boats accelerated, the island turned around and attacked the boats. The one boat that managed to get back to the coast relayed his tale of a huge turtle, apparently millennia old and the size of an island."
