+msgid "A dragon is a legendary creature, normally seen only in fantastic tales. They are very rare, and were it not for the historical events, the singlehanded destruction of cities and towns that these creatures have wrought, they might be dismissed as mere myth. Legends are very specific about the ravages of dragons; noting their great strength, speed, their preternatural cunning, and above all else, the great fire that burns inside of them. The most ancient libraries of Wesnoth record some details regarding the solitary nature of dragons, impossible to verify in more recent times. They did not appear to suffer the presence of other dragons. On the few occasions they have been observed in pairs, the occasion was a fight to the death, most often between an adult and a juvenile presumably attempting to establish territory. In no case was a juvenile observed to survive these encounters. Though dragons have not been observed to mate, it is known that they lay eggs. These eggs however, are peculiar in that they do not hatch in the presence of the parent. They have been observed to lie in the dragon's lair for hundreds of years, with hatchlings emerging only after the death of the parent or, in some rare but significant cases, removal of the eggs from the lair. It is presumed that these peculiar habits exist by reason of the vast territory required to provide meat, which dragons consume in large quantites. Battling a dragon is said to be the pinnacle of danger itself, fit only for fools or the bravest of knights."

+"Compared to humans, elves are somewhat taller, more agile but less sturdy. They have slightly pointy ears, pale skin and usually blond hair. Few differences between humans and elves are more pronounced than the Elves’ unusually long life — most, unless claimed by illness, accident or war, live a full two and a half centuries. While some elves possessing a high magical aptitude have been known to live an additional full century, most elves begin to grow physically frail at some point between 250 and 300 years of age and pass away rapidly (generally within a year or two) thereafter.\n"
+"\n"
+"Elves are naturally imbued with magic to a small degree. Though most are unable to channel it directly, its latent presence gives them their keen senses and long life. Many elves have magic-driven talents such as marksmanship or stealth, allowing them to achieve tasks that most normal beings would find astonishing. Those elves that learn to wield this power in more general ways can become truly formidable in its use. Many choose to use their gift to heal others.\n"
+"\n"
+"A few elves, venturing far down the paths of magic and mysticism, become sensitive to the presence of cold iron and can even be burned by it. Elvish legend hints that this was more common in the far past.\n"
+"\n"
+"Elves spend much of their time honing their talents and skills. Those not adept at the magical arts typically devote their time honing their physical skills. As a result, elves excel at archery, which is perhaps their most important method of warfare. Most elvish troops carry a bow and no other race can rival their archers in speed and accuracy. All elves also share an intense affection for unspoiled nature. They often feel uncomfortable in open unvegetated spaces. They live primarily in the forests of the Great Continent; the Aethenwood in the southwest, Wesmere in the northwest, and the great northern woods of which the Lintanir Forest is the southernmost edge.\n"

Their flippers, though admittedly not of much use propelling them on land, can shatter the strongest of fortifications with one sweeping blow, the armored plates that compose its shell can withstand the strongest of physical and magical attacks. They are a sight to be feared by all who would dare to stand in the path of such a behemoth.
