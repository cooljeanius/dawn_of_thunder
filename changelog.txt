todo before next release:
-update the first forum post
-peasant arrival
-elyser unit graphics for fiannon
-redo description goblin cutthroat
-Naia's resistance amla gives 15% instead of 25% (Maybe fiannons as well?)
-adjust fiannon's description
-Naia's teleport is still manly
-Thindromli's presentage message is wrong. Only amlas, no lvl up
-lycantropy giving false amount of hp
-turtles message is far too late
-DOT abbreviation for savefiles?
-Egoist is described with '...and thus needs twice as much time to level up. +70%XP to advance.' which mean the unit needs (to be exact) 1.7 times as much. Or 'almost' twice as much.
